    <p><strong>Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken</strong> is a succulent and zesty dish that elevates the natural flavors of chicken with a refreshing blend of herbs and citrus.<br>
        The boneless, skinless chicken breasts are marinated in a mixture of olive oil, fresh lemon juice, minced garlic, and a medley of dried oregano, thyme, and rosemary.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

                        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
                                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken:</li>

<ul> <li>In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, making sure it's well-coated.</li>
        <li>Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally, marinate it for a few hours to allow the flavors to penetrate the chicken.</li>
            <li>Preheat the Grill:</li> </ul>

<li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
<ul><li>Grill the Chicken:</li>

<li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and let any excess drip off.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken breasts on the preheated grill. Grill each side for about 6-8 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C), and the chicken is no longer pink in the center.</li>
        <li>Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts.</li></ul>
<li>Rest and Serve:</li>

<ul><li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley and serve with lemon wedges on the side.</li></ul>
    </ol>

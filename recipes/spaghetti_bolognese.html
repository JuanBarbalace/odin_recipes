        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sautéing Aromatics: The dish typically starts by sautéing onions and garlic in olive oil until they become fragrant.</li>

            <li>Adding Vegetables: Finely chopped carrots and celery are often added to the mix, contributing sweetness and depth of flavor.</li>

                <li>Browning the Meat: Ground beef and pork are then added and cooked until browned. The browning process enhances the flavor of the meat and adds richness to the sauce.</li>

                    <li>Incorporating Tomatoes: Crushed tomatoes or tomato paste is introduced, providing the base for the sauce. The tomatoes bring acidity and a vibrant color to the dish.</li>

                        <li>Simmering: The sauce is allowed to simmer for an extended period, allowing the flavors to meld and intensify. This slow cooking process is crucial for developing the characteristic depth of a Bolognese sauce.</li>

                            <li>Seasoning: Seasonings such as dried oregano, basil, salt, and pepper are added to enhance the taste of the sauce.</li>

                                <li>Serving with Pasta: The finished Bolognese sauce is ladled over cooked pasta, traditionally spaghetti. The pasta absorbs the flavors of the sauce, creating a hearty and satisfying meal.</li>

                                    <li>Garnishing: Grated Parmesan cheese is often used as a garnish, adding a final layer of richness to the dish.</li>
